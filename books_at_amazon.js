        description: "Giraffes Can't Dance is a touching tale of Gerald the giraffe, who wants nothing more than to dance. With crooked knees and thin legs, it's harder for a giraffe than you would think. Gerald is finally able to dance to his own tune when he gets some encouraging words from an unlikely friend.",

I have read this book probably a hundred + times (not an exaggeration) and I still love it. I haven't found a child who didn't like this book, it's so cute. Great story, nice colorful illustrations. I highly recommend this book!",

It is so easy to identify with the emotions of the giraffe who was highly ashamed of not being able to dance and felt SO alone until he started to follow his passion.",

I want all of our family's little ones to enjoy the beautiful message of this book. I think the age range (3-7) is on target, but I know younger toddlers will like the cadence of this rhyming story, as well as it's brevity. Can't think of a better book to read before tucking children into bed. Beautifully illustrated.",
